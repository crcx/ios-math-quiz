ios-math-quiz
=============

A small math quiz application for my kids to practice with.

This will eventually support random problems (selectable by addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and simple division), and number ranges.

I've written something similar when I first started working with iOS, but have
decided to rewrite it using Swift and storyboards.
